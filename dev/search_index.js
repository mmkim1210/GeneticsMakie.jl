The package provides convenient wrapper functions for wrangling genetic association results and  plotting them using Makie. Every component of a figure  can be easily customized and extended. The package generates high-quality, publication-ready figures.

Familiarity with these packages allow visualization of any type of genetic and genomic data.  Makie's default layout tools are particularly useful for  plotting different genetic and genomic data modalities on separate layers.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"note: An usage case\nIf you have run a genome-wide association study (GWAS) at the variant-level,  and you would like to eyeball genome-wide significant loci across hundreds of phenotypes, then you are in the right place.","category":"page"}]
